<article>
<p>In this weeks assignment 2 Project 2 I decided to keep the flow going from the previous assignment. The theme is the parts of an App game with upselling options.</p>
<p>Maybe it can be different promotions per season or different designs being sent for review. The main idea here is that this is what I image it will be like going part by part regarding coding for apps and beyond.</p>
<p>I am very interested in getting the coding down to a science or at least enough for me to make killer apps for businessess and game apps.</p>
